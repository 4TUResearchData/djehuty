# Djehuty Governance

Djehuty is _Free & Open Source Software_, powering research data repositories and developed for 4TU.ResearchData. 
Djehuty is powering the 4TU.ResearchData repository ([data.4tu.nl](https://data.4tu.nl/)) and the Nikhef 
data archive ([archive.nikhef.nl](https://archive.nikhef.nl/)).

Djehuty follows a community-driven governance model to ensure transparent decision-making and inclusive participation. 
It affects who, what, and how roles are assigned, and how decisions are made and implemented.

Djehuty’s codebase is maintained by [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/); its governance bodies include:

- The members of the 4TU.ResearchData team
- The 4TU.ResearchData Operational Board and Executive Board
- The maintainers of the Djehuty codebase
- The wider community in the science, engineering and design disciplines

Djehuty governance is aligned with 4TU.ResearchData’s strategic goals and values<sup>1</sup>:

- We provide leading, domain-specific infrastructure for research data and software
- We are a trusted repository; ensuring continuity, sustainability, and reliability
- In the development of the repository, we aim to be flexible and open to community input
- We aim to connect and integrate with tools/services across the research lifecycle using open standards, protocols and persistent identifiers


## Decision Making Process

Our process is inspired by the **three levels of decision-making** adopted by the [Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/governance/) 
and in the [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) communities. 
These broad levels describe the norms and formal processes that affect how decisions are made in Djehuty.

### 1. Community Level

- **Who**: All users of 4TU.ResearchData services, potential adopters of Djehuty, and external developers or contributors
- **Scope**: Raising issues, reporting bugs, requesting features, creating pull requests, providing feedback, contributing documentation or tutorials.
- **Process**:
  - Feedback is collected via GitHub issues, mailing lists, workshops, and community calls.
  - All community contributions are acknowledged, logged, and triaged by the maintainers.
  - Contributors follow the contributor guidelines (see [contributing.md](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme))
- **Decision rule**: Community members do not make binding decisions, but their input strongly informs priorities at the Maintenance and Constitutional levels.

### 2. Maintenance Level

- **Who**: Maintainers of the Djehuty codebase; the team consists of _core maintainers_ (4TU.ResearchData staff members) and optionally additional _community maintainers_. 
- **Scope**: Day-to-day technical decisions, bug fixes, pull request reviews, release management, and implementation of approved features. 
Focus areas may differ per maintainer, but they all share the same responsibility when it comes to code review, community support, release testing, roadmap planning, and new contributor mentoring.                  
Core maintainers ensure Djehuty’s direction and are admins on all infrastructure for Djehuty where possible, including communication channels, the 4TU.ResearchData GitHub Org and repositories.
- **Process**:
  - Maintainers follow the contributor guidelines (see [contributing.md](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme)).
  - Contributors can request or be invited to become maintainers, based on consistent, quality contributions.
  - Maintainers can only be appointed and removed by core maintainers.

**Decision rule**: Maintainers decide by consensus where possible; if consensus is not reached, the core maintainers as 
a group have the power to veto any decision by majority vote. Core maintainers have power to resolve disputes as they 
see fit, or can escalate to the Constitutional Level.

### 3. Constitutional Level

- **Who**: Representatives from the 4TU.ResearchData Executive Board and the Operational Board, and optionally 
representatives of organisations that make a significant contribution to the project.
- **Scope**: Strategic, long-term decisions: project roadmap, governance model updates, security and sustainability 
policies, licensing, and alignment with 4TU institutional priorities.
- **Process**:
  - Both the 4TU.ResearchData Executive Board and Operational Board meet regularly.
  - It reviews progress, approves major architectural and functional changes, provides feedback and input on workplan/roadmap
- **Decision rule**: Decisions are made by consensus; if consensus is not reached, the decision is made by majority vote. 

## Meeting schedule
- Weekly maintainer meeting
- Quarterly planning with Operational Board 


## Code of Conduct
All participants must adhere to our Code of Conduct (see: [code_of_conduct.md](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty?tab=coc-ov-file)) 
to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
