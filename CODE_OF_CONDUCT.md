# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community for everyone who participates in this project. By participating in this project, you agree to follow our Code of Conduct.

## Encouraged Behaviours

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community’s expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.
With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:
- Be respectful and considerate in your communication.
- Use inclusive and welcoming language.
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the project and the community.
- Assume good intent, and seek to resolve conflicts in a kind and collaborative way.
- Commit to repairing harm when it occurs.

### Unacceptable behavior includes:
- **Harassment**. Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- **Character attacks**. Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
- **Discrimination**. Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- **Sexualization**. Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- **Violating confidentiality**.Sharing private or security-sensitive information without consent.
- **Endangerment**. Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, contact Core Maintainers via email at [djehuty@4tu.nl](mailto:djehuty@4tu.nl).

Core Maintainers take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Core Maintainers will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

Core Maintainers are responsible for upholding the Code of Conduct.
They may take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from the community, depending on severity of violation and frequency of incidents.

Once an unacceptable behaviour occurs, we expect the person(s) involved to commit repairing harm. The repair may involve a written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and making a thoughtful reflection on their actions and impact.
