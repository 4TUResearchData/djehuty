\chapter{Contributing}

This chapter outlines how to set up an instance of \t{djehuty} with the goal
of modifying its source code.  Or in other words: this is the developer setup.

\section{Setting up a development environment}

First, we need to obtain the latest version of the source code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ git clone https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty.git
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we need to create a somewhat isolated Python environment:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ python -m venv djehuty-env
$ . djehuty-env/bin/activate
[env]$ cd djehuty
[env]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

And finally, we can install \t{djehuty} in the virtual environment to make
the \t{djehuty} command available:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ cp pyproject.toml.in pyproject.toml
[env]$ sed -i 's/@VERSION@/0.0.1/g' pyproject.toml
[env]$ pip install --editable .
\end{lstlisting}

If all went well, we will now be able to run \t{djehuty}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ djehuty --help
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Configuring \t{djehuty}}

Invoking \t{djehuty web} starts the web interface of \t{djehuty}.  On what
port it makes itself available can be configured in its configuration file.
An example of a configuration file can be found in
\file{etc/djehuty/djehuty-example-config.xml}.  We will use the example
configuration as the basis to configure it for the development environment.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ cp etc/djehuty/djehuty-example-config.xml config.xml
\end{lstlisting}

In the remainder of the chapter we will assume a value of \t{127.0.0.1} for
\t{bind-address} and a value of \t{8080} for \t{port}.

\subsection{Modifications to the example configuration for developers}

\subsubsection{Live reload}

The \t{djehuty} program can be configured to automatically reload itself when
a change is detected by setting \t{live-reload} to \t{1}.

\subsubsection{Configuring authentication with ORCID}

The \t{djehuty} program does not have Identity Provider (IdP) capabilities,
so in order to log into the system we must configure an external IdP.  With
an \href{https://orcid.org}{ORCID} account comes the ability to set up an OAuth
endpoint.  Go to \href{https://orcid.org/developer-tools}{developer-tools} at
\href{https://orcid.org}{orcid.org}.  When setting up the OAuth at ORCID,
choose \t{http://127.0.0.1:8080/login} as redirect URI.

Modify the following bits to reflect the settings obtained from ORCID.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
  <authentication>
    <orcid>
      <client-id>APP-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</client-id>
      <client-secret>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</client-secret>
      <endpoint>https://orcid.org/oauth</endpoint>
    </orcid>
  </authentication>
\end{lstlisting}

To limit who can log into a development system, accounts are not automatically
created for ORCID as IdP.  So we need to configure who can log in by creating
a record in the \t{privileges} section of the configuration file.

This is also a good moment to configure additional privileges for your account.
In the following snippet, configure the ORCID with which you will log into
the system in the \t{orcid} argument.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
  <privileges>
    <account email="you@example.com" orcid="0000-0000-0000-0001">
      <may-administer>1</may-administer>
      <may-impersonate>1</may-impersonate>
      <may-review>1</may-review>
    </account>
  </privileges>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Invoking \t{djehuty}}

Once we've configured \t{djehuty} for development use, we can start the web
interface by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ djehuty web --initialize --config-file=config.xml
\end{lstlisting}

The \t{-{}-initialize} option creates the internal account record and
associates the specified ORCID with it.  We only need to run \t{djehuty}
with the \t{-{}-initialize} option once.

By now, we should be able to visit \t{djehuty} through a web browser at
\href{http://127.0.0.1:8080}{localhost:8080}, unless configured differently.
We should be able to log in through ORCID, and access all features of
\t{djehuty}.
