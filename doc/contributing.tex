\chapter{Contributing}

This chapter outlines how to set up an instance of \t{djehuty} with the goal
of modifying its source code.  Or in other words: this is the developer setup.

\section{Setting up a development environment}

First, we need to obtain the latest version of the source code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ git clone https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty.git
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we need to create a somewhat isolated Python environment:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ python -m venv djehuty-env
$ . djehuty-env/bin/activate
[env]$ cd djehuty
[env]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

And finally, we can install \t{djehuty} in the virtual environment to make
the \t{djehuty} command available:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ sed -e 's/@VERSION@/0.0.1/g' pyproject.toml.in > pyproject.toml
[env]$ pip install --editable .
\end{lstlisting}

If all went well, we will now be able to run \t{djehuty}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ djehuty --help
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Configuring \t{djehuty}}

Invoking \t{djehuty web} starts the web interface of \t{djehuty}.  On what
port it makes itself available can be configured in its configuration file.
An example of a configuration file can be found in
\file{etc/djehuty/djehuty-example-config.xml}.  We will use the example
configuration as the basis to configure it for the development environment.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ cp etc/djehuty/djehuty-example-config.xml config.xml
\end{lstlisting}

In the remainder of the chapter we will assume a value of \t{127.0.0.1} for
\t{bind-address} and a value of \t{8080} for \t{port}.

\subsection{Modifications to the example configuration for developers}

The chapter \refer{chap:configuring-djehuty} describes each configuration
option for \t{djehuty}.  The remainder of sections here contain a fast-path
through configuring \t{djehuty} for use in a development setup.

\subsubsection{Live reload}

The \t{djehuty} program can be configured to automatically reload itself when
a change is detected by setting \t{live-reload} to \t{1}.

\subsubsection{Configuring authentication with ORCID}

The \t{djehuty} program does not have Identity Provider (IdP) capabilities,
so in order to log into the system we must configure an external IdP.  With
an \href{https://orcid.org}{ORCID} account comes the ability to set up an OAuth
endpoint.  Go to \href{https://orcid.org/developer-tools}{developer-tools} at
\href{https://orcid.org}{orcid.org}.  When setting up the OAuth at ORCID,
choose \t{http://127.0.0.1:8080/login} as redirect URI.

Modify the following bits to reflect the settings obtained from ORCID.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
  <authentication>
    <orcid>
      <client-id>APP-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</client-id>
      <client-secret>XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</client-secret>
      <endpoint>https://orcid.org/oauth</endpoint>
    </orcid>
  </authentication>
\end{lstlisting}

To limit who can log into a development system, accounts are not automatically
created for ORCID as IdP.  So we need to configure who can log in by creating
a record in the \t{privileges} section of the configuration file.

This is also a good moment to configure additional privileges for your account.
In the following snippet, configure the ORCID with which you will log into
the system in the \t{orcid} argument.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
  <privileges>
    <account email="you@example.com" orcid="0000-0000-0000-0001">
      <may-administer>1</may-administer>
      <may-impersonate>1</may-impersonate>
      <may-review>1</may-review>
    </account>
  </privileges>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Invoking \t{djehuty}}

Once we've configured \t{djehuty} for development use, we can start the web
interface by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[env]$ djehuty web --initialize --config-file=config.xml
\end{lstlisting}

The \t{-{}-initialize} option creates the internal account record and
associates the specified ORCID with it.  We only need to run \t{djehuty}
with the \t{-{}-initialize} option once.

By now, we should be able to visit \t{djehuty} through a web browser at
\href{http://127.0.0.1:8080}{localhost:8080}, unless configured differently.
We should be able to log in through ORCID, and access all features of
\t{djehuty}.

\section{Navigating the source code}

In this section, we trace the path from invoking \t{djehuty} to responding
to a HTTP request.

\subsection{Starting point}
Because \t{djehuty} is installable as a Python package, we can find the
starting point for running \t{djehuty} in \t{pyproject.toml}.  It reads:
\begin{lstlisting}
[project.scripts]
djehuty = djehuty.ui:main
\end{lstlisting}

So, we start our tour at \file{src/djehuty/ui.py} in the procedure called \t{main}.

\subsection{How \t{djehuty} initializes}

The \t{main} procedure calls \t{main\_inner}, which handles the command-line
arguments.  When invoking \t{djehuty}, we usually invoke
\t{djehuty \textbf{web}}, which is handled by the following snippet:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
import djehuty.web.ui as web_ui
...
if args.command == "web":
    web_ui.main (args.config_file, True, args.initialize,
                 args.extract_transactions_from_log,
                 args.apply_transactions)
\end{lstlisting}

So, the entry-point for the \t{web} subcommand is found in
\t{src/djehuty/web/ui.py} at the \t{main} procedure.

This procedure essentially sets up an instance of \t{ApiServer} (found in
\t{src/djehuty/web/wsgi.py} and uses \t{werkzeug}'s \t{run\_simple} to start
the web server.

\subsection{Translating URI paths to internal procedures}

An instance of the \t{ApiServer} is passed along in werkzeug's \t{run\_simple}
procedure.  Werkzeug calls the instance directly, which is handled by the
\t{\_\_call\_\_} procedure of the \t{ApiServer} class.  The \t{\_\_call\_\_} procedure
invokes its \t{wsgi} instance, which is configured as following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
self.wsgi = SharedDataMiddleware(self.__respond, self.static_roots)
\end{lstlisting}

The \t{\_\_respond} procedure calls \t{\_\_dispatch\_request}

In \t{\_\_dispatch\_request}, the requested URI is translated into the procedure
name using the \t{url\_map}.  So, except for static resources in the
\t{src/djehuty/web/resources} folder and pre-configured static pages, URIs are
handled by a procedure in the \t{ApiServer} instance.

A mapping between a URI and the procedure that is executed to handle the
request to that URI can be found in the \t{url\_map} defined in the
\t{ApiServer} class in \file{wsgi.py}.

\subsection{Diving into the code that displays the homepage}

As an example, in the \t{url\_map}, we can find the following line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
R("/", self.ui_home),
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, \t{self} is a reference to an instance of the \t{ApiServer}
class, so we look for a procedure called \t{ui\_home} inside the
\t{ApiServer} class.  Some code editors have a feature to ``go to definition''
which helps navigating.

The \t{ui\_home} gathers the summary numbers from the SPARQL endpoint
with the following line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
summary_data = self.db.repository_statistics()
\end{lstlisting}

And a list of the latest datasets with the following line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
records = self.db.latest_datasets_portal(30)
\end{lstlisting}

It then passes that information to the \t{\_\_render\_template}
procedure which renders the \file{portal.html} in the
\file{src/djehuty/web/resources/html\_templates} folder.  The Jinja%
\footnote{\dhref{https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/}} package
is used to interpret the template.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
return self.__render_template (request, "portal.html",
                               summary_data = summary_data,
                               latest = records, ...)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Database communication}

In the \t{ui\_home} procedure, we found a call to the
\t{self.db.repository\_statistics} procedure.  To find out by hand where that
procedure can be found, we can look for the place where \t{self.db} is
assigned a value:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
self.db = database.SparqlInterface()
\end{lstlisting}

And from there look up where \t{database} comes from:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
from djehuty.web import database
\end{lstlisting}

From which we can conclude that it can be found in
\file{src/djehuty/web/database.py}.

In the \t{repository\_statistics} procedure, we find a call to
\t{self.\_\_query\_from\_template} followed by a call to \t{\_\_run\_query}
which takes the output of the former procedure as its input.

As the name implies, \t{\_\_run\_query} sends the query to the SPARQL endpoint
and retrieves the results by putting them in a list of Python dictionaries.

The \t{self.\_\_query\_from\_template} procedure takes one parameter, which is
the name of the template file (minus the extension) that contains a SPARQL
query.  These templates can be found in the
\file{src/djehuty/web/resources/sparql\_templates} folder.
